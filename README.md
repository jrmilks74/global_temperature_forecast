This Shiny app uses multiple linear regression to fit the model Global Mean Temperature ~ Atmospheric CO2 levels + Solar irradiance + El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation + Aerosol Optical Depth. I then use time series analysis to forecast future behavior of each predictor variable then use those forecasts to predict future behavior of global mean temperature using the main model above.
